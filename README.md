# CS 4240 Tiger Compiler Frontend

###### By Sam Mohr, Harish Kamath, and Andrey Lukin


### 1. Design Internals
* Project Structure
    * ```./grammar/```
        * ```Tiger.g4``` contains the grammar used by ANTLR to generate a parse tree of an inputted Tiger program.
    * ```./parser/```
        * ```TigerLexer.java```, ```TigerBaseVisitor.java```, ```TigerParser.java```, and ```TigerVisitor.java``` which is all code generated by ANTLR to allow us to traverse the parse tree.
        * ```SymbolTable.java``` is our implementation of the Symbol Table used to handle scopes and variables.
        *  ```Tuple.java``` our small implementation of a Tuple class to use in the Symbol table.
        *  ```Tiger.java``` is our main program that runs a the Tiger frontend compiler on the input.
    *  ```./project1_test_code/```
        * Contains ```testing.sh```, a bash script used for testing   
        * Contains different files with test inputs for the IR, Symbol Table, and basic Tiger code.


### 2. How to Build
* For compilation of the Tiger compile, running ```bash ./compile.sh``` will:
    1. Run ANTLR on the grammar provided in ```/grammar/Tiger.g4``` and create all necessary Java classes in ```/parser/```.
    2. Compile all of the Java files in the parser folder.
* To test, running ```bash ./project1_test_code/testing.sh``` will:
    1. Run the normal compilation routine.
    2. Run the Tiger compiler on all of the test code provided in the ```/project1_test_code/``` directory.

### 3. Run Examples
* ```java ./parser/Tiger ./project1_test_code/test1.tiger.txt```
